        <p>Book circulation at the University of Maryland library systems decreased by nearly 57% from 2009 to 2018, but that may not be due to a decline is students’ reading.</p>

        <p>In fact, UMD’s Library Services Unit Coordinator James Spring calls that notion “patently false.” </p>
        <p>This decrease in circulation has occurred at the same time that University of Maryland’s total enrollment has increased by nearly 10% in the last decade. </p>
        <p>Spring says there may be many other factors responsible for the decline in book circulation: changes to the library system, closure of a couple library branches on campus, the emergence of eBooks and the current technological age lending to students reading more through other methods. </p>

        <p> Unlimited renewals may have a part in the decreased circulation. These have come into effect at some point in the last decade, though the exact date is unknown. </p>
        <p>“They used to have to bring them back to the library and check them out again… if somebody had something for a long time,” Spring said. </p>
        <p>The loan period for undergraduates has also increased, from 56 days in 2009 to 84 days in 2014 where it remains now, which gives students 50% more time with a book before it is due. This may lead to less overall circulation as less students will return then check out the same book to elongate their time with it– which Spring says many students do instead of simply renewing a book– and it gives popular books less opportunity to be checked out by multiple students.</p>
        <p>“Popular material is now sequestered with an individual for 50% longer,” Spring said. “Which will push that next circulation… to an interlibrary loan.” </p>
        <p>When a book is checked out through the UMD library system, but comes from a different library, the data does not count in UMD’s circulation statistics, which could also be a reason for the decline.  </p>
        <p>“There are going to be a lot more interlibrary loans now,” Spring said. “We (did) sort of a large scale reorganization of the collection… as being part of the big 10.” </p>
        <p>The library system also moved a number of books into an offsite storage location, which “slowed down the ability for people to browse the location,” Spring said. </p>
        <p>In addition to these circulation changes, Spring said that the closure of two libraries¬ in 2018– the Engineering and Physical Sciences Library and the White Memorial Chemistry Library– could have affected circulation negatively. </p>
        <p>However, the UMD College Park library system still never had less than library branches than it did in 2009¬– eight– because those two closed libraries merged into the STEM library, and before that Severn Library opened in 2016, which means that from 2016-2017 there were actually nine libraries. Still, changes to the library’s branches could have affected circulation. </p>

        <p> A surge in eBook usage may also have taken the place of some print book circulation at the library. The library offers many eBooks, and these downloads do not count toward circulation data. Library data shows that eBook chapters were accessed over 1.5 million times in 2018, far more than print books were checked out.</p>
        <p>“We have been buying a crazy amount of eBooks,” Spring said. </p>

        <p>EBooks may not be the only other form of reading that students do, at the expense of print books, more now than a decade ago. </p>
        <p>“Even if we’re not talking about books, people read so much more just in reading the Internet today,” Spring said. “How much reading goes into (this generation’s) socializing? Probably a lot.” </p>

        <p> University of Maryland students pointed to more forms of reading, too, that takes precedence over print for them.  </p>
        <p>Finn Osterhout, a sophomore from Rhode Island who is pursuing a mechanical engineering degree, said he has only checked out one book from the library– and it was required for a school project. He says he mostly reads textbooks, and that when he reads for his own enjoyment, he prefers the accessibility of the Internet over checking out a book at the library.</p>
        <p>“It’s a lot easier to find stuff online to read,” Osterhout said. “Than to go to a library.” </p>
        <p>Junior Dillon Whittle, a Prince George’s County native studying Economics, said that though he does check out a book from the library “every few months,” most of his reading is “news sources like… New York Times, Washington Post… ESPN… and it’s all online.” </p>

        <p>"Our physical circulation is a very important stat and I would love to see it rise, but it isn't everything," Spring said, emphasizing that the library offers a host of resources besides print books, including equipment, librarian consultations, research guides, study spaces, computers and printing and scanning.</p>
        <p>With these resources, despite the circulation decline, library attendance is high. Spring estimates that the school’s most popular library, McKeldin, gets about 150,000 visits each month during the school year. Recently, sensors have been installed at the library to more accurately ascertain attendance. </p>
        <p>And, 2018 showed the first increase from the previous year in book circulation over the decade. Spring says he is “very encouraged by the uptick,” but wants to wait for future data before drawing any trends. </p>
        <p>“I kind of want to wait and see if it stays for another year,” Spring said. “One uptick might be anything.” </p>
